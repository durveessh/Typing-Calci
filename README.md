Typing Speed Calculator ⌨️🚀
🚀 Project for CodeClause Internship 🚀

The Typing Speed Calculator is a web-based tool that accurately measures typing speed in words per minute (WPM) and evaluates accuracy. It provides real-time feedback, helping users improve their typing efficiency.

✨ Features:
✅ Real-time Speed Calculation – Instantly calculates WPM as you type.
✅ Accuracy Measurement – Highlights errors and tracks precision.
✅ Customizable Text Inputs – Choose different texts for practice.
✅ Minimalist & User-Friendly UI – Clean interface for distraction-free typing.

This project is developed as part of my internship at CodeClause, showcasing my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for real-time applications.
